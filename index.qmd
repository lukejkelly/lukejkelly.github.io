My research interests are in computational statistics and phylogenetic inference. Most recently, I have been developing couplings of Monte Carlo algorithms on the space of phylogenetic trees ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13328), [poster](https://github.com/lukejkelly/Poster/blob/master/poster.pdf)).

See [here](https://www.ucc.ie/en/matsci/people/) for my contact details.
[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=bZ3L-mkAAAAJ&sortby=pubdate) lists my publications and [GitHub](https://github.com/lukejkelly) hosts code for my research projects.

At Universit√© Paris Dauphine-PSL, I was a postdoc in the CEREMADE (2020--2022).
At the University of Oxford, I was a senior postdoc in the Big Data Institute (2019--2020), a stipendiary lecturer at St Peter's College (2019--2020) and a postdoc in the Department of Statistics (2016--2019).

I completed my DPhil in Statistics under the supervision of Geoff Nicholls at the University of Oxford in 2016.
I received an MASt in Mathematics from the University of Cambridge in 2012 and a Bachelor of Actuarial & Financial Studies from University College Dublin in 2011.

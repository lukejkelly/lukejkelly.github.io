My research interests are in computational statistics and phylogenetic inference. Most recently, I have been developing couplings of Monte Carlo algorithms on the space of phylogenetic trees ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13328), [poster](https://github.com/lukejkelly/Poster/blob/master/poster.pdf)).

See [here](https://www.ucc.ie/en/matsci/people/lukekelly/) for my contact details.

I was at Universit√© Paris Dauphine-PSL as a postdoc in the CEREMADE (2020--2022).
I was at the University of Oxford as a senior postdoc in the Big Data Institute (2019--2020), a stipendiary lecturer at St Peter's College (2019--2020) and a postdoc in the Department of Statistics (2016--2019).

I completed my DPhil in Statistics at the University of Oxford in 2016 under the supervision of Geoff Nicholls.
I received my MASt in Mathematics from the University of Cambridge in 2012.
I obtained my Bachelor of Actuarial & Financial Studies from University College Dublin in 2011.

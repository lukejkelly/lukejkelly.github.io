    "text": "My research interests are in computational statistics and phylogenetic inference. Most recently, I have been developing couplings of Monte Carlo algorithms on the space of phylogenetic trees (paper, poster).\nSee here for my contact details. Google Scholar lists my publications and GitHub hosts code for my research projects.\nAt Université Paris Dauphine-PSL, I was a postdoc in the CEREMADE (2020–2022). At the University of Oxford, I was a senior postdoc in the Big Data Institute (2019–2020), a stipendiary lecturer at St Peter’s College (2019–2020) and a postdoc in the Department of Statistics (2016–2019).\nI completed my DPhil in Statistics under the supervision of Geoff Nicholls at the University of Oxford in 2016. I received an MASt in Mathematics from the University of Cambridge in 2012 and a Bachelor of Actuarial & Financial Studies from University College Dublin in 2011."
